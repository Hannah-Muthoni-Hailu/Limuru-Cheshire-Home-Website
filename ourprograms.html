                                Maimonides once said, <q>â€œGive a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime</q>Our institution serves young girls who suffer from several disabilities with the most common kinds being mental challenges. These inhibit the children's ability to learn in normal school environments. However, we do believe that knowledge is power. Therefore, we have employed a group of teachers who are well-equipped to assess and handle the various needs of all the students and provide them with the highest quality of education possible based on their ability.

                            <p>
                                The textile industry is a major industry in Kenya and is a source of income for a large number of Kenyans, mostly women. We at <abbr>LCH</abbr> strive to give our girls the necessary skills needed to be competitive in this field. They are involved in tasks like dressmaking, knitting, and crochet work. During their stay at the Home, their products are frequently sold with the gains from those products being given to the girls as pocket money. Our graduates continue to work in the textile industry and carve a comfortable life for themselves in society.

                            <p>
                                Using beads to create different forms of art is a very mentally stimulating activity for children living with disabilities. Aside from the health benefit, we encourage our girls to engage in beadwork as it is a reliable income source in most Kenyan societies and a great way of nurturing their creativity.

                                We are living in an era where technological advancements are evolving at a very rapid rate. It is therefore mandatory that we equip the girls with skills that enable them to cope in this technological age. We have a modern computer laboratory as well as a very skilled computer teacher who helps the girls learn basic computer skills. Some of the girls who are up to the task are given further, more comprehensive information.

                                Farming is both a pleasurable and profitable activity. Our girls spend time working on the open farm and greenhouse producing a wide variety of crops from maize to mushrooms. Most of them have become highly skilled in these activities and some of these products are given to visitors as souvenirs and we have received many compliments on the crops' amazing quality. Some of our graduates have gone on to manage very successful farms.

                                Children love animals and so do the girls at our home. Taking care of the livestock on our farm is one of the tasks that the children look forward to every day. It offers them the opportunity to be outside around animals and at the same time learn basic facts on how to properly maintain livestock.

                                Our skilled chef not only provides sumptuous meals for the girls three times a day but also takes her time to train them in the art of baking and cooking as well as basic table-laying skills. These activities will benefit the girls when they leave the Home when they have to leave on their own allowing them to be self-reliant. It would also provide a very efficient source of income.

We hold daily prayer sessions and weekly mass with a well-trained chaplain who is also available every day of the week to minister to the children's spiritual needs. We also have bible classes included in the girl's reading and writing curriculum.

                                Many of the girls at our home suffer from various physical impediments. These girls receive physiotherapy sessions regularly from a team of highly competent physiotherapists who handle the girls with plenty of love and care. These sessions benefit the girls by improving their mobility and reducing any pain they may struggle with due to their disabilities.

Most importantly, in play, children learn how to learn.</q> Based on this wise principle, we strive to offer our girls an opportunity to have fun through play. We have a well-equipped sports room with various balls, skipping ropes, and other play items. We offer the children at least an hour a day to be outside engaging in various physical activities under the watchful eye of our P.E. teacher.

The matrons who take care of the girls are also skilled nurses who can help with minor emergencies and provide first aid in case of a major event before the doctor arrives.
