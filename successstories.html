                        Salima was born with a disability that caused her father to detest her existence to the point that he would have rather had her thrown than continue to live with her as his daughter. The abuse from her father got so severe that at some point, Salima considered suicide by throwing herself from a tall building.<br>
                        Thankfully, she has a supporting mother who accepts her as she is. Her mother constantly encouraged her by telling her that, <q>One day, my child, your life will change.</q> Her predictions came to when she was accepted into <abbr>LCH</abbr>. Here, she found a community of people who love and value her despite her challenges.<br>
                        Since joining the Home, Salima has been able to transform her life. She has learned many valuable skills that will enable her to live a fulfilling life in the future. She mostly enjoys beadwork, a task that she has become extremely skilled at.<br>
                        Salima has dreams of starting her own knitting and beadwork business after graduating from <abbr>LCH</abbr>. She longs to support her mother by building for her a home with solar power and water thus alleviating her from the state of poverty that she has raised Salima in.<br>

                    <p>
                        Joy has resided at Limuru Cheshire Home alongside over 50 other girls for the past two years. This home provides refuge from her impoverished household in Deep Sea, an extensive informal settlement situated on the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya’s capital city in the northwest<br>
                        According to Sr. Rose Catherine Wakibiru, the Administrator of <abbr>LCH</abbr>, <q>The 19-year-old is intellectually challenged and is the most normal child in a family of seven children. Joy’s mother has an intellectual disability as well. And all her seven children have one or the other disability. The only healthy member of Joy’s family is her father who does menial jobs in the slums to provide for his big family</q><br>
                        Despite her special needs, Joy attempted to go to a regular school but dropped out when she found it difficult to keep up with other children who didn’t have special needs.<br>
                        <q>I always came last in class from the time I started going to school. Teachers always punished me, thinking I chose to be a slow learner</q>, Joy recalls. This was before she reverted to begging on the streets to try and help her father provide for their family.<br>
                        She was eventually rescued by <abbr>ACI</abbr> and brought to the Home. She has enjoyed her stay here so much that she can barely fathom the thought of graduating and leaving the Home.<br>
                        Joy has undertaken training in dressmaking, bakery as well as computer literacy and her work has won admiration from many of the visitors of the home. She finally graduated from the home on the 25<sup>th</sup> of December 2020. She has been able to start her own business and support her family through it.
