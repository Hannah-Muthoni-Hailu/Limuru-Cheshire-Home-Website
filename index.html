                        <p>
                            Nestled on a sprawling piece of land in a tranquil rural area near Limuru, within Kenya’s Kiambu County and under the jurisdiction of the <em>Archdiocese of Nairobi</em>, stands <em>Limuru Cheshire Home</em>. This compassionate institution provides care and support for young girls who face physical and intellectual challenges. Girls hailing from various regions across East Africa seek refuge at this institution, hoping to find solace amidst their challenges. The community-based empowerment facility hosts 60 girls, all of whom grapple with either physical disabilities or intellectual impairments.
                            <br>
                            The institution provides an empowerment program that encompasses vocational training. The girls actively participate in activities like dressmaking, cookery, knitting, and beadwork. Additionally, they receive physiotherapy and counseling. Rehabilitation services are available to support them, enabling them to live with dignity. Furthermore, the institution conducts comprehensive community outreach programs to raise awareness about these girls.
                            <br>
                            Originally established as a residence for cancer patients, the Limuru facility transformed in 1972 to become a home for girls facing physical challenges. In 1986, it came under the management of <em>ASN (Archdiocese of Nairobi)</em>, and today, it is one of the four institutions registered under <em>Cheshire Disability Services Kenya (CDSK)</em>.

                            Nearly five decades ago, World War II hero Geoffrey Leonard Cheshire, a distinguished veteran, founded the facility. <br> After the war, he dedicated himself to charitable endeavors, establishing communities for ex-service individuals. In subsequent years, he extended his efforts by constructing homes for cancer patients and people with various disabilities worldwide.<br> Before his passing in 1991 at the age of 74, Cheshire, who had served as an official British observer during the dropping of the atomic bomb on Nagasaki—an event aimed at ending the war in the Far East—had initiated charitable projects in 52 countries across the globe.

                            After the facility was converted from a cancer facility to a home for disabled children, it was placed under the management of the Cheshire Disability Services. <br> This is an organization dedicated to disability inclusion. CDSK collaborates with a network of 41 Local Partner Organizations (POs) in Kenya. Their joint efforts focus on implementing programs in areas such as Community-Based Rehabilitation & Care, Inclusive Lifelong Education, Socio-economic Empowerment, Sexual Reproductive Health & Rights, and Institutional Development.
