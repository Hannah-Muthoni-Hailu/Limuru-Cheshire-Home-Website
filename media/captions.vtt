00:00:10.541 --> 00:00:13.097
Limuru Cheshire home is a home

3
00:00:13.297 --> 00:00:15.567
for girls with special needs.

4
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.460
And basically it's about two things.

5
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.620
One, to enable them to function as much as

6
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:31.660
possible, independent and live, and two,
to come up with a vocational skill

7
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:40.080
that can act as an income generating
skill when they leave these premises.

8
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:49.020
Most of our students are brought in here
by social workers who have either been

9
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:57.380
requested to help settle a conflicting or
a girl that is really being molested or

10
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:06.770
violated, or a girl living in a scenario
where there's a lot of incest.

11
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.410
So when they come the first day is
just welcoming them and let her be.

12
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.660
So that you also assess their temperament,

13
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.100
their likes, whether
she's feeling homesick.

14
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.620
You just listen to them.

15
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.930
Most of them like to talk a lot and they

16
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.900
keep saying, don't lock me,
don't close, lock me in a room.

17
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.340
So then you get to know, who is this?

18
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.340
What are they referring to?

19
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.020
The second week now you
start what they need.

20
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.540
Like if somebody have to be bathed,
you make sure that is in place.

21
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.460
If they have to be dressed,
make sure that is in place.

22
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.140
If you find she can't do her
laundry, you just organize.

23
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.180
So the first week is just
watching them and taking note.

24
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.620
And then you come up,

25
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.260
you draw an individualized

26
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:14.170
empowerment plan.

27
00:02:14.171 --> 00:02:14.197
Music

28
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.890
The first year is self
management and life skills.

29
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.220
The second year is an exposure to the nine

30
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.780
vocational skills that we offer
with an aim of knowing the God given

31
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.980
potentiality trapped
within the individual.

32
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.700
And now she has to leave the other nine

33
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.420
vocational skills and we zero
into this particular one.

34
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.380
If it is cookery, dressmaking, knitting,

35
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.820
with a bind of her being able
to take the kniter exams.

36
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:57.580
And in the fourth year,
now we zero in into preparing her

37
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:05.300
for graduation and also entrepreneurship
skills that she will be able to know how

38
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:13.480
to handle the customer, how to compete
ably outside there in the business world.

39
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.060
This year, around October, November,
we are intending to graduate 24.

40
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.740
We are meant to go out after the 9th month
of their graduation to find out how they

41
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.020
are doing, if they are succeeding,
what are the success stories?

42
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.940
If they are not, what are the issues?

43
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:42.320
And can we work together with their
caretakers and unravel, find a solution?

44
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:49.520
Music

45
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.660
These girls need a lot,

46
00:03:51.690 --> 00:04:01.440
a lot of appreciation, recognition and
just knowing that you are there for them.

47
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.140
I answer to God's call.

48
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.700
The core issue is my ability
to identify what God is saying.

49
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.610
I have to ensure as I wake up

50
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:21.060
in the morning that they feel, they feel I
love them, they know I care and that's it.

51
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:28.540
And that I create that free space
that the child knows nothing can harm me.

52
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.900
And once they feel safe and secure,
they start talking, they start moving.

53
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.060
And it's so beautiful
to watch them unfold.

54
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.420
So that sense of being useful

55
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:48.580
and the conviction that God wants me to be
here, that gives you the drive,

56
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:56.760
the desire, and also
the keenness now of consulting.

57
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:07.260
I see the young one walk in from the gate,
and I see them walk out,

58
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.420
and I can comfortably tell
the transitional

59
00:05:12.450 --> V
level of the empowerment that we have
done and what finally we have achieved.
